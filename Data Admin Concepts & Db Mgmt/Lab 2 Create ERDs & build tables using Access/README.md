Problem Description
(1) You need to use the relational data model to illustrate the relationships among
members of Twitter, a social media service. To simplify the problem, just consider
that any member can have a profile, and have one or more members in his/her
network.
(2) You need to design a simplified Library Database System. Assume the Library
employee can loan out books to Customers, and Customer can loan out one or more
books.
2. Instruction
Create two ERDs according to the following instruction
(1) Create necessary entities, and give appropriate names to them.
(2) Add entity attributes. Make sure their attributes are at atomic level using good
naming conventions (no composite attribute, no multi-value attribute).
(3) Set up primary key for each entity.
(4) Establish relationships between entities. Give the relationships appropriate names
(show forward verb phrases only) and recognize the associations (foreign keys).
(5) Mark correct cardinality of the relationships.
(6) Use MS Access to build the tables, establish relationships, and add sample data.
Please attach the datasheet view of each table and the relationship model with your
report.
