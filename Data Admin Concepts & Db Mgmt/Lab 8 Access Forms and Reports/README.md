In this lab, we will be using the same database (career service) we created before. We will be
creating forms and a report in MS Access that will input/output data from the SQL Server
database. Connect the SQL Server database we used in lab 4, 5, 6 and 7, and finish the following
questions:
1. Company and Position(s) Form: <br/>
    Create a Master-Detail form (form/subform) that will
    allow you to add Company and their positions. Display all the Company attributes. Add a sub
    form for positions offered by the company and display all position attributes (Company ID
    may or may not be there since all the positions listed under the company belong to the
    company). This form should allow adding and deleting both companies and their offered
    positions. You may need to add a button to delete a company. Attach screen shots of your
    input Forms and proof that they work properly. For example, add and delete records. Use
    results of SELECT queries to show the results of the insertions and deletions using the forms.
2. Candidate and Interview Form: <br/>
    Create a master-detail form (form/subform) in MS Access
    that will allow you to select a particular Candidate and display the Interview details for that
    Candidate. Attach screen shots of your form and proof that it works properly.
3. Interview Summary Report: <br/>
    Create a report that lists all Interviews information including
    Interviewer ID, Interviewerâ€™s last name and first name, Candidate ID, Candidate last and first
    name, Interview ID, and Interview date. Order the report by Interview Date. Also list all
    positions for which interviews were conducted displaying Position ID, Position name,
    Position Level. Attach screen shots of your report.
    Use appropriate controls for representing the form fields (for e.g., text box, combo box, etc.).
    Use good labels to describe the fields.
