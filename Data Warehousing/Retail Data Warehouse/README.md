This is a repository for the data warehouse project of Dominic Finer Food(DFF). Created staging and data warehouse area using MS SQL server 2016. Performed ETL using SSIS, created reports using Report Builder 3.0 , SSAS and SSRS

Project Overview
The project is focused towards creating a centralized data warehouse repository that consists of
aggregated data coming from different stores. The data warehouse databases provide a
decision support system in which user can calculate and evaluate the performance of the
organization over time. The data will be stored in a series of snapshots, in which each record
represents data at a specific time. By analyzing the snapshots, one can compare among the
time periods. These comparisons can help user make important business decisions.
A Data warehouse stores the data organization wide like, customers, employees, products,
locations, date and time. Data Mart are used to departmentalize these different attributes for
analyzing the change in business based on their period data snapshots. The is denormalized to
improve query performance. The collection from heterogenous sources shall be converted into
one standard form for evaluation and analysis. This way the extracted data is transformed and
then based on our warehousing approach it can be loaded into the warehouse.
The Integration and loading of data is a smooth functionality that provides ease of utilization.
The main reason to implement warehouse is to provide better business decisions,
departmentalization of data, product and customer analysis and increased organizational value.

In scope :
● Building a warehouse that provides an estimate of the sales and CRM based on the
historical data.
● A system that generates KPIs for World Mart based on the historic data that can be used
for analytics
● Module that includes Datawarehouse, Data mart and Decision Support System
Generation
● Integration Testing and Beta support testing Mechanism
● IT training to the employees and End User training pre-deployment phase
● A maintenance plan to provide support to the employees in cases of system crashes and
periodic consultation routines to ensure the smooth working of the system.
