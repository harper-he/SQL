### Data Warehousing 
This course introduces the concepts of **business intelligence (BI)** and the practice/techniques in building a BI solution. Students focus on how to use data warehouses as a BI solution to make better organizational decisions. Topics include concepts, principles and tools for **designing, and implementing data warehouses**. Students learn the differences between **Ralph Kimball’s** and **Bill Inmon’s approaches, roles and responsibilities** in the design and implementation of a data warehouse, **project management guidelines** and **techniques**, and **requirements gathering**. Coursework also covers **dimensional modeling**, **Extract Transform and Load (ETL) architecture**, **specification and data loading**, and **master and reference data management**, as well as **integration approaches (ETL, EII, EAI), analytical reporting concepts, data governance** and recent trends in the data warehouse domain.<br>
