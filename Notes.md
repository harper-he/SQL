SQL views and with clauses are very similar. Here are some differences.

>Views create an actual object in the database, with associated metadata and security capabilities. With statements are only part if a single query.<br>In many databases, views have options, for instance to index them or to "instantiate" them.<br>With statements offer the opportunity to have recursive CTEs, in some databases. This is not possible for views.<br>For simple subqueries incorporated into queries, they are quite similar. The choice really depends on whether you want to create a reusable code (views) or are focused on a single query (with).

>Fundamentally, the definition of a view is saved in the database and can be reused by any query, whereas a WITH clause (or Common Table Expression, or CTE) is tied to one specific query and can only be reused by copying.<br>Otherwise, they will be substantially the same.<br>If you use a recursive WITH clause, then you can't achieve the same result in a VIEW unless the view definition itself uses a WITH clause (which is legitimate).
